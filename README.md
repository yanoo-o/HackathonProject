# kaagapay

Kaagapay is an all-in-one health app that would bring health services to the countryside, even to those communities without internet and mobile signal. The kaagapay app offers two functionalities, online and offline.

For the online functionalities, the app can be used as a centralized appointment system for hospitals, an online doctor's consultation hub, and a comprehensive information encyclopedia.

The offline functionalities let the people use the app without internet and can be distributed through APKs. It contains readily information about diseases that could help patients get home remedies or immediate health care for emergency situations. It can also be used as an appointment system, where the app can send a free text message to the nearest hospital that would set an appointment for the patient.
